## description

"django-pygments" is a Django app that provides a template tag and two
filters for doing syntax highlighting with [Pygments][1].

## dependencies

- [Pygments][1]

## installation

- Add "django\_pygments" to your project directory and to INSTALLED\_APPS
  in your "settings.py",
- If you want to see the integrated demo page, add a "urls.py" entry for
  "django\_pygments.views.demo".

The project is also available on PyPI:

`pip install django-pygments`

## usage

- Enclose your code snippet in a pre tag with the non-standard "lang"
  attribute set to a supported language like this:
```html
<pre lang="python">....</pre>
```
- See the view and demo template for examples on how to use the
  "pygmentify" and "pygmentify\_inline" filters (the latter is rather
  useful for RSS feeds, because it inlines CSS styles by passing
  `noclasses=True` to `pygments.formatters.HtmlFormatter`) or the
  "pygment" tag.
- While using the "pygment" template tag, you can pass keyword arguments
  that you would pass to Pygments HtmlFormatter class constructor by
  passing them as with keyword arguments along with the pygment tag. Look
  at demo template for examples. There is one caveat with this feature
  still. You can only pass Python values as argument values (like strings
  wrapped within quotes or True or False boolean values, etc.). It doesn't
  support Django template/context variables as arguments yet.

  E.g: to disable line numbering, use:

```htmldjango
{% pygment linenos=False %}
    <pre lang="python">...</pre>
{% endpygment %}
```

## notes

- The custom HTML formatter class displays each line as an ordered list
  element, thus implementing line numbering without interfering with
  copy/pasting.
- To see a list of supported languages, look at the "lexer\_names"
  variable in "utils.py".
